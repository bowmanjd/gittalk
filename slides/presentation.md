Notes:

Welcome. I am Jonathan Bowman. I enjoy collaboration, sharing, and code re-use, and I am hoping you might as well, because those are the very things we are talking about today.

“Staging” and other overwrought metaphors <!-- .element: class="darktext r-stretch" -->

Notes:

Have you ever heard of "home staging"?

|||

Staging: setting the stage for what will be

|||

In software, pretty much all we do is "staging"

|||

## Imagine you are a home stager

- moving couches
- setting tables
- getting the pillows and rugs just right
- finally presenting to the customer

|||

## The difficulties

- collaboration is a communication nightmare <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Remembering and redoing are tedious <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- sharing and responsibility aren't always natural (who did what and why?) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

|||

## Take staging to the next level

<span class="fragment">With a robot</span> <span class="fragment">and a camera</span>

Named git <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

|||

# With git you can...

- stage your stuff
- Take <span class="fragment">(commit)</span> snapshots
- review and restore snapshots
- share snapshots with others who can even revise them

We write words that make computers do stuff

```
git clone git@github.com:Cargas/playground.git
git pull
echo something >> README.md
git add .
git commit -m "I added something"
git push
```
